Sounds.json file Notes:
Notes: In Vanilla Minecraft , the "type" enumeration values are declared as:
"sound" -> corresponds to a sound file.
"event" -> corresponds to a sound group.
However , in modded Minecraft Forge we see another scheme to take action:
"file" -> corresponds to a sound file.
"event" -> corresponds to a sound group.
